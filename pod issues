LAB: Troubleshooting Pod Issues
Troubleshooting Tip


If you would like to know whats the current status of the pod, and if its in a error state, find out the cause of the error, following command could be very handy.

kubectl get pod vote -o yaml
Lets learn by example. Update pod spec and change the image to something that does not exist.

kubectl edit pod vote
This will open a editor. Go to the line which defines image and change it to a tag that does not exist

e.g.

spec:
  containers:
  - image: schoolofdevops/vote:srgwegew
    imagePullPolicy: Always
where tag srgwegew does not exist. As soon as you save this file, kubernetes will apply the change.

Now check the status,

kubectl get pods  
 
NAME      READY     STATUS             RESTARTS   AGE
vote      0/1       ImagePullBackOff   0          7m
The above output will only show the status, with a vague error. To find the exact error, lets get the stauts of the pod.

Observe the status field.

kubectl get pod vote -o yaml
Now the status field shows a detailed information, including what the exact error. Observe the following snippet...

status:
...
containerStatuses:
....
state:
  waiting:
    message: 'rpc error: code = Unknown desc = Error response from daemon: manifest
      for schoolofdevops/vote:latst not found'
    reason: ErrImagePull
hostIP: 139.59.232.248
This will help you to pinpoint to the exact cause and fix it quickly.

Now that you are done experimenting with pod, delete it with the following command,

kubectl delete pod vote
 
kubectl get pods
